SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),THEME II,THEME III,Strategy
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,"I first looked at the percentage probability that the AI had for the selected image answer.  Then I searched the path of the AI image and looked at the other options in the category.  If I doubted the AI answer, I did search inquiry on what I thought it might be and then looked at available images in the path of possible choices.  If the AI probability was low, I felt better choosing an object I felt was correct.  On images that were difficult to see, I took best guess after researching alternatives."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,"I first tried to identify it to the furthest extent of my own knowledge and discernment, whereafter I would consult the AI if the aforementioned did not avail me. If the object was immediately unknown to me, then likewise I would immediately use the AI's suggestion. At times, I would deem the AI to be close to the mark but not quite, and I would thus use the AI's categorization as a starting point."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,"Sometimes the AI was just way off, so I just searched for what I thought it was and found the closest item. If the AI was close, I would click it, and scroll through the images in the same or nearby hierarchies. If I had a feeling the AI was wrong, but I couldn't confidently figure out what the object was, in these cases, I just went with the AI prediction."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,I looked to see if the AI matched it if not I tried to find what the picture was.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,"My strategy was that I first looked at the AI's prediction to see if I thought it was correct or was a close match. If I thought the label matched the image I went with the AI's label, and if I thought the label was close but not an exact match to the image I looked for similar related labels to the one that was predicted. If I thought the AI prediction was completely wrong I just made my best guess of what the image label should be."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I used the AI mostly when I was really unsure about the image.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"If I knew the answer, I did not use assistance. If I could not tell, I went with what the AI said."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I used the AI as a basis and checked how many choices there were for me to choose from. I looked through the choices the AI gave and decided on whichever one I thought looked closest to the image on the left.
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,,I used the words and categories to look what other labels are available
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),DISAPPOINTED AT AI,"I first tried to decide on what I thought the image on the left was on my own. Usually, I was confident in what I thought I saw and would then check that against the AI prediction. It normally just served to reinforce my beliefs and I ignored it when they conflicted, as the AI was usually clearly wrong with a very low confidence (sub 20%). In cases where I was unsure, I would usually go with the AI if it had any confidence at all (50% or higher)."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I tried to make sure the AI was correct by studying the image really well
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I used the AI for the most part. Unless something was obviously wrong.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,"The AI's prediction was certainly helpful, especially on ones that I didn't really know much about. My strategy was to first look at the image to be identified to see if I could tell what it was. Then I looked at the AI's prediction to see if it matched what I was thinking. If it did match, I just clicked on the second image. If it didn't match, I searched and looked around the tree to see if I could figure it out. Some of them had to just be best guesses, as the images were quite blurry and distorted."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),"Sometimes the ai image looked exactly like the image and was obviously correct. That helped differentiate from similar objects (like the wolf spider was clearly a wolf spider, so I didn't have to guess what sort of spider). Sometimes it was clearly wrong, and then I was on my own, but sometimes it helped get me an idea of at least what sort of item I might bee looking at."
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,,"I looked carefully at the AI's prediction but then compared it with all of the images in the subcategories. I compared things such as color, shape, other identifying factors such as spots,"
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,"I just tried to picture it as best I could, but if the AI prediction was kind of high I'd go with the AI."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"When the AI was way off the mark, I started my own searches, knowing that the images were going to be image of reptiles and invertebrates. When the AI seemed close to the blurred image, I looked at images in the other sub-category that might be closer before deciding which label to go with.

I'm really puzzled that the entry that showed a drafting table found that label ""Not to be found"" in the label database. I ended up choosing "" safe"" because there was a safe in the picture, but that answer was incorrect. I do knoe that it certainly wasn't a pool table, which is what the AI suggested."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,"Unless I knew exactly what the picture was (computer mouse, Dobermann dog), I pretty much went with the AI's predictions. I figured it was more in tune with this entire process than I am, so I was more inclined to believe it than my own thought of what the picture was."
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,"If I had no idea what it was, I would click on the AI prediction and then look at all the pictures available that were in the same set as the AI prediction, and sometimes I would go back a subset or two.  If I had no idea and could not find something similar to the picture I had to identify, I would end up going with the AI prediction."
UNINFORMATIVE,,,When I thought they were right I chose what they -Icked
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,I primarily collaborated with the AI unless it obviously looked incorrect.
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,Sometimes it was obviously what the AI said it was. Other times it seemed close but not the same so I would open the image and go through the tree backwards trying to find the correct object if I was unsure just by looking at it.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,"I mostly tried to come up with an independent prediction first, before looking at the AI's best prediction. But I was mostly unable to do so because I didn't know the names of a lot of the entities depicted, or couldn't tell what they were. I thought even the lower-percentage guesses of the AI often were better than what I'd have been able to come up with on my own, and so often went with the suggestion given. Where I strongly disagreed (e.g., pig versus black bear), I think I mostly went ahead with my own idea."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY DROPDOWN),,"I checked the image for the AI predicted label and then if it matched, I labeled it what the AI suggested. If not, I used the drop down tags to find something similar under the different headings."
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,,If I thought the object was something completely different I still clicked to see the label path to see if there was anything similar it might be. If I agreed I would still click to see the path so I could use the correct lable.
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),SEARCH,,"I used the AI guess if it looked right or i just couldnt tell, otherwise i used the search method"
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),"If the AI's prediction looked similar to the image, I clicked on the AI representative to verify the choice or look for other similar choices that might fit better. If the predicted image was not similar, I used keywords to start a fresh search."
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,"I just mainly stuck with what it predicted, some were hard to determine"
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,"I went with AI's prediction every time, even when I thought I knew better because I thought AI would always be correct but I should've only went with AI when I didn't know."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"I compared both images. If the AI image looked nearly similar, I would go with Ai. If not, I would look for something else"
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),"If the probability was at least 45% - 50%, then I went with the AI suggestion."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,took at as advice but not necessarily the answer
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),First I looked at the image myself to see what it was. Then I saw if the AI was close. Regardless I would then click into the AI and look around the category it is in. If it was completely off I'd resort to searching and looking myself. Sometimes I just clicked around to look through the hierarchy and understand it better.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,"I would compare the image on the left with the AI image. If it was completely different, then I would try to figure out what I thought I was looking at. At times, the images were similar so I would click on the AI image to see the image tree and then hover over each image to see if any of the other pictures in the similar categories matched better."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH,"firstly, accept or reject that the AI was in the right area, if rejected use my own search"
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,I would look at the AI prediction to see if it was correct. but if it was not then I would just go with what I know.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,I used the AI predictions when I had little idea what the image was. When I had a decent guess I would look at the AI's prediction and the predicted accuracy.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I usually tried to identify the picture on my own before consulting the A.I.. If I wasn't sure what the picture was, then I would would look at the A.I. prediction and decide if it seemed reasonable."
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"A lot of it was recognition of what the object was, if I wasn't able to tell I would reference the AI ideas and pictures to try and source what it could be."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,"I would use the AI predictions as a guide, sometimes. Then I would look around at other options that were similar to see if something else matched better."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,"First I tried to figure out what it was in my own resident encyclopedia brain and match it from there. When that didn't work, I expanded the tree from AI's prediction and tried to get somewhere there. Sometimes I was able to find what I was looking for and others, I chose AI because I couldn't find the right thing. Some I know were wrong, but I couldn't get there."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,DISAPPOINTED AT AI,"I started with more general images (bird, snake) and checked them against photos.  I got frustrated because sometimes I didn't find what I wanted (chocolate lab).  And I KNOW that first one was a feather boa, LOL.  What the heck???"
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,If I agreed with the AI then I went with it's decision quickly. If I disagreed and I knew what the image label was then I searched for it and cross-checked the actual target image with the example shown in the tree diagram returned by the search. If I couldn't find something that seemed more correct than the AI then I went with the AI even if I didn't think it was right.
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I mostly clicked on the AI's prediction image to view the tree, and then I would go through the options to find whatever photo looked the most similar. Unless the AI was obviously wrong, then I would use the search feature."
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,,"If I didn't know what it was, I just went with the AI prediction."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I looked at the picture and tried to predict what it was then looked at the ai to confirm or deny what I predicted
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),"I compared my own knowledge about what the pictures looked like and compared them with the sample images that the AI presented with it's label. If it was wrong and I knew what it needed to be, I just typed the name in myself. When I didn't know what the object was supposed to be and the AI had given something similar, I relied on looking at the trees of objects connected to the AI's guess."
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,I sometimes looked at the hierarchy If it was something similar to the guess
SEARCH,SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,"I generally tried to identify what I thought the item was first and entered that in the search box unless I was absolutely certain that the AI prediction was correct, such as with the guinea pig. If I wasn't sure, I looked at the pathway for the AI prediction and previewed the other suggestions in the same directories as the prediction to compare with the given ImageNet picture."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH,,"The AI was helpful half of the time I found, especially for wildlife.  For the rest, I attempted to think of real world objects that would match the image.  Some were simple, but others were difficult due to not seeming to find the correct keywords to get the results I was looking for in the search."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"If I was either completely certain that the AI was right or completely unsure of what it could possibly be, I went with the AI's prediction"
UNINFORMATIVE,,,I paid attention to the percentage. I also looked at the picture on the left closely.
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,I clicked on the AI suggestion to see if there was a category that seemed to be more accurate. I found it easiest to work my way through the AI's suggestions than search on my own usually. Sometimes I was just checking that there didn't seem to be a better answer even though I was pretty sure the AI suggestion seemed accurate. I searched on my own a few times when the AI seemed very inaccurate.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,"I first looked at the AI prediction to see if it looked like the picture, and if it did not, I tried to think of what it could be. After I thought of what it could be I searched the categories the best I could, trying to find the best match."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,I look closely at an image and also paid attention to the AI percentage.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH,DISAPPOINTED AT AI,"If I saw the image and knew what it was, I put down whatever I thought, regardless of what the AI said. If I had no idea what the item was, then I generally went with what the AI suggested. However, there were a couple of times where I didn't know what the image was but I knew that the AI was definitely wrong. In those instances, I tried to guess the object based on the category I thought it belonged in."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,Some of the images were so low-quality that since I had no blooming idea what the thing in the picture was that I had a better chance with the AI than I did trying to guess some off-the-wall thing. I wish I could've known more of what they were but my chances were better throwing in with the AI than going it alone.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH,,"I tried to figure out if I could make out the image on my own. If I wasn't sure, I went with the AI's suggestion because it was better than nothing."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY LABELS),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),"I attempted to use the AI prediction to narrow down category. If the images were similar enough, I just went with the prediction. After that, I looked at the category of the AI prediction to see if any of the other things in that category matched. If I didn't find a close enough match, I searched for something general and tried to trace down the specific category on my own. The AI classifier did help on most occassions, but it did confuse on others."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,I tended to use the AI unless I thought there was no way it was correct
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,,"for most of the objects I opened the A.I. prediction in the tree then I compared the A.I. guess to other similar branches near the A.I. guess, for instance on the dog pictures I looked through the similar dogs in the decision tree and compared it to the A.I. guess.  I was very frustrated multiple times with not being able to select an option I could not find, one of the objects was obviously a drafting table and there was no option for drafting table or anything close to a drafting table I had to pick a desk even though I knew I would get the answer wrong, another time I wanted to select feather as the object and there was nothing even close to a feather I had to pick feather boa anyway that sums up my thoughts."
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,I feel like the AI was more accurate in classifying images because some were blurry.    I started to value the AI predictions more
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH,,"The first thing I did was look at the image and see if I had an idea of what it was, then check if I agreed with the AI's prediction. If I did, I went with the AI's prediction. If not, I tried to search for what I thought it was."
COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES: SEARCH,,"I didn't have an especially complex strategy; I took in the images almost simultaneously, compared them quickly, then focused on the shape and texture of the image in need of a label. When the difference was either very pronounced or minimal but still difficult to parse, I took extra time to consider the details of the image and thought shortly about why AI might have broadly mislabeled something (not really thinking much when it labeled correctly). And I really appreciated the layout and organization of the search tool. It was visually appealing and easy to use."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,My experience in working as a veterinary professional and studies in zoology helped me a lot.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I looked at the AI prediction and the percentage it had in being correct.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"Some things, like particular dog breeds or specific reptiles, I am unfamiliar with so I primarily wanted to rely on the AI's answer for them. But sometimes it can be difficult to tell how the AI sees a certain thing, when displaying its own image guess with something that looks completely different."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH,,"It was really helpful for some images, especially animal identification, I don't know how to identify a vine snake, or nematode, so at least it got me started in the right direction.  I would consider what the AI suggested, and if I disagreed I'd try and find something that matched better.  Sometimes I wasn't able to do this, and just went with the AI's suggestion even though I didn't think it was right, I simply didn't have a better guess then it did."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,I started by looking at the percentage of accuracy.  If it was above 50% I leaned on the AI prediction
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH,SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),"If I thought the picture looked similar to what the AI predicted, I'd usually use it. But, if it didn't I'd either search or look through the path to find a choice that was better in my opinion."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I would look at the AI prediction, and make a guess if it is similar to my initial thought."
UNINFORMATIVE,,,I tried to fact check the AI but I wasn't allowed to write the real answer.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,"Sometimes it was right, but it wasn't specific enough. Other times it was wrong so I simply ignored it. I had the problem of the item I wanted to type not even being an option."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"Usually I agreed with the AI's identification. In some cases, the image seemed to actually be very different from what the AI suggested and in that case I figured out what I thought it was and used the search menu to look for what I thought was the correct label."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,Just used the AI predictions if I thought they were correct. If not then I searched what I thought it looked like.
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,The AI would often be correct or in the ballpark of what the item was. I would typically click on the AI for other predictions similar to what was chosen or if the image was still indecipherable I would just do my own search with prior knowledge.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),REPRENTATIVE IMAGES,There were some I definitely could tell what they were and the AI image just helped justify my answer. Some  was not sure about and having a way to view other photos close to my guess helped me decide what I would choose. I had a few that had a close AI suggestion but needed to be tweaked slightly
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,It was difficult to collaborate - it either helped me identify the image or it absolutely didn't.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),DISAPPOINTED AT AI,"I had great difficulty determining what a few of the photos were. In those cases, I didn't feel that the AI prediction was helpful. I think there were a few times that I should have relied on the AI prediction and did not. I primarily used the decision tree to see how the AI decided and to find other options when I thought the AI was wrong."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"I looked at what label the AI assigned and the percentage they gave, and then I looked at the sample picture to see if I thought it matched and was correct.  Many of the pictures were blurry, so it was sometimes hard to tell what I was looking at! In cases where I really was unsure and did not know what the picture was, I relied on the AI and went with their label."
SEARCH,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,If I knew the image I searched for it. Sometimes I knew AI was right but other times I could not tell and tried to trust the AI.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I did not find the AI particularly helpful. The strategy I used  was my own personal memory and thought processes in determining the image.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,"Sometimes the AI helped me a little bit, but for some of the pictures I had no idea what object it was since the object was blurred."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I tried to base it off what I thought it was than went from there. Ok do it look like an object of an mammle. Than go from there.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"By looking at the image, I got a general impression of what I thought it was.  If it matched the AI's prediction, it was easy just to go with that suggestion.  When I didn't agree with the AI's prediction, the task became vastly more difficult as I believe I only got one or two right when I had a differing opinion from what the AI suggested.  Though I searched the database using different key words and ideas, I rarely was able to find a good match on my own.  By the end, I went with the AI's suggestion most of the time unless I was very confident it was wrong because I did not do well with my independent guesses."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,Sometimes it was obvious that it wasn't what the AI predicted it was. If I wasn't sure I looked at the AI's options first. If I knew what it was I typed it in.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I just used my intuition. Some of the pictures I could recognize easily and others I could not.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,There were times I was convinced about what I was seeing I did not follow the AI. Otherwise I stuck to following the AI or at times would look at the picture with the AI guess helping me and think of similar object/ animals etc that are similar the AI guess if I didnt think the AI was right.
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,,"I used the AI's prediction to base my search from. Most of the time if the AI was not correct, it was at least somewhat close to what the image was and made it easier to search"
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,I mostly relied on the AI's prediction unless I was certain it was something else.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,"If I didn't know what was in the image, I just went with the AI. If I knew what it was, I went with my own knowledge. If I was pretty sure, but the AI had a respectable percentage, over 50% then I would defer to it. Also, I'm like 90% sure that one of the last trials was a pig, but I got it wrong even though it was a pig."

SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,,"I picked up some of the main characteristics of the similarities that the AI generated response drew, and  ""categorized"" those (color, shape, size, etc.)"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,My strategy for identifying the correct label for each image is to try to identify the object myself without the AI. After checking to see if I can do it myself i'll look at the Ai's suggestion and make a more informed decision on what it is i'm looking at. Sometimes the AI would be totally off other times it would be spot on. I used the Ai as something to confirm with but not rely on it's predictions.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"With the images, I first guessed on my own and compared my guess to the image I was trying to label.

AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),DRILLING DROWN (HIERARCHY),"I usually started with the AI prediction and checked the similar objects to see if there was a better match, i.e. if I could tell a dog was a hound but wasn't sure the AI predicted the correct breed then I would look at images of the other breeds for a closer match. Some things I couldn't tell what it was at all in the image. For those, I tried exploring categories in the tree that I thought it might be, but a few of the images were too blurry or obscured to tell what it was at all. For those, I just went with the AI prediction because I could be looking forever without any certainty I would ever find the right match."

SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,,"When I clicked on the image to see all the suggestions a picture would match the one, I was guessing at."
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,,It was difficult to identify the images presented. Using the AI was helpful sometimes just that the list was so long to chose from.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,The AI was either clearly correct or wrong for the most part. For a few images there was a useful ambiguity to its predictions that allowed me to guess.
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),SEARCH,,"I agreed with AI on some instantly, with others I looked a few things up to see if they were a better match or not."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),Started with AI label. Some seemed obviously correct. Ones I disagreed with I looked for a label that fit better. One picture looked like a mosquito but there is no such thing in your labels that I could find. Only mosquito netting. So I went with the AI but pretty sure that was wrong.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,"I studied the image intensely, then compared to AI prediction. If it didn't come close, I search for what I though it could be."
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,,I chose based on the prediction of Ai and search engine.

SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,I started with the AI hierarchy tree (except for a couple where the ai was obviously wrong) which often verified the ai was correct. If still unsure I searched out from there within the hierarchy.  If still unsure I searched on my best guess. There were a couple where the Ai seemed clearly wrong and I used the search function with what i thought the image was.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH,,"I tried my best to find what I thought it was when I knew the AI to be wrong but had a difficult time find ing the correct object in the lists. I would start with what the AI said and then check the other kinds of dogs for instance to find the right one, then I would go backward or start over with my own keyword,"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),"I first tried to guess the image myself. Then I referred to the AI. If the AI agreed, I went with it. If the AI disagreed, I reevaluated my own guess. If I was clueless, I just went with the AI."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH,"First, I looked at the image without looking at the AI prediction to make a guess for myself. Secondly, I looked at the AI prediction. Third, I looked at the AI prediction's percentage. Finally, if I was sure I agreed, I typed in the label. If not, I pulled up the tree to get an idea of the AI's path and tried to find a match."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),"I basically looked at AI's prediction and paid attention to the % match. I compared AI's pic to my pic. If I thought they were correct, I agreed. If I thought they were close, I checked AI's answer and packed up on the chart an answer or two. If I thought they were way off, I used keywords and did my own search to narrow down.

AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,"Some of the images were hard to even identify so I had to guess at those. Some of the images that the AI predicted, I checked first to see if they were right. Some I just trusted the AI."
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),"I tried to identify the images the best I could. I expanded them, and anything I thought looked similar to the image I searched to see if the label existed - which made it basically guaranteed it was correct.  Most of the time, the image was so distorted had to trust the AI."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,Sometimes especially with animals I looked at other similar ones in the category to see if there was a better fit.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"I tried to figure it out myself first. If I knew for sure what it was, I went with that. If I thought I knew but wasn't completely sure, I checked against the AI. If I had no idea at all, I used the AI."
SEARCH BY AI LABEL,,,clicked ai prediction and select appropriate option.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,My strategy was to rely on the AI predictions when I wasn't sure what I was looking at. Otherwise I relied on what i thought it was
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,"If the AI's prediction was quite low, I would try to search for the image myself. If I could clearly identify the image, then I would rely on my own thinking and confirm if it matched with the AI's decision. If the AI's confidence was high and I agreed with the decision, I went with what the AI classified the image as."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,If I know what it was I automatically I answered it by myself. I then clicked on the classifier and looked at various pictures to narrow it down.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"I would look at picture and if they matched then I would pick the animals, items in the AI picture and then click the corresponding animal or item and click the appropriate name of it.  Sometimes it was completely non useful as it didn't say what the image was when it it wasn't the exact animal or item. I thought I knew my animals haha but I only got 5.25 so I only got 5 extra which isn't to bad but I thought I would do better"
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,"First, I tried to identify the object in the image myself. Next, I consulted the predict of the AI. If I am confident my assessment of the image between my own judgment and the AI's recommendation, I proceed. If I am unsure or the AI disagrees, I would review other reference images in the category trees to try and find distinguishing attributes of the different options to make an educated guess on whether to accept the AI's recommendation or choose a similar category."
SEARCH BY AI LABEL,,,I used the AI to look at the other options to make sure that it was showing the correct choice.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I examined both images well before using the AI's predictor. If I knew it was not the right name for the image, I used the other image's predictor or just typed it in. Most of the time, I used the AI's predictor."
