THEME I,THEME II,THEME III,Strategy
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,"Since the AI had such a high accuracy rate, I trusted the AI suggestions and went in order of its suggestions from most confident to least confident until I saw the item I agreed with."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I thought the AI was helpful in narrowing down options overall. It was good to see the kinds of insects and animals it had to help narrow down my choices at first.
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I checked all images that could be possible matches and tried every label underneath to try to find a more exact match.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"First I tried to see if I could identify the image myself. If I couldn't, I would go down the list of the AI's predictions to see if I could find anything that looked similar. If I couldn't, I would just go with my best guess."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"Most of the images seemed to be recognizable myself, but a good portion were unknown, in this case the AI was useful for things I couldn't recognize."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I went with what AI prediction and went through the categories to try to guess what label would be correct. Most of the time AI had a label already displayed for me to click. Some I was not sure on.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST& AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I looked at the image and made sense of what I thought things looked like to my knowledge. Then I looked at the AI's answers and hovered over them to see if the image looked similar.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"I looked at the AI predictions to see if there was an obvious answer. If not I typed something that I thought was close to the answer, or chose one of the predictions that I thought was close. Then I searched through the labels until I found what I thought was correct."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I guessed at what I thought it was, then checked to see if AI had some suggestions along those lines"
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,"I generally tried to see if my view of the image matched any suggestions by the AI, such as contrasting and comparing different types of areas, etc."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"I went through the list provided and moused over to see the reference image to help me determine what the image was.  It was tough on the images that were not clear, but the AI gave me a direction to go in on most of them."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,"I looked at the AI classifier's set and then determined if the picture matched one of the items. If I wasn't sure, I would manually search for it."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"I first studied the image against the given label predictions, and then looked at the sample images for the labels I thought might be accurate. I then selected the best choice from those options."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I tried to use my own knowledge at first. If it wasn't something I recognized, I tried to come up with a broad category to search for so I could look through the available photos."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"My strategy was to look at the image and see if I knew or could figure out what it was, and I used the AI predictions to narrow down (eg, going from ""dog"" to ""Dobermann""), or if the image was difficult to see or unfamiliar to me (like the one with the rosehips) I used the AI to guide me in considering possibilities."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I tried to guess the object on my own.  I used the AI suggestions to confirm my own guess.   I also used the AI suggestion if I did not know what the object was at first glance.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY DROPDOWN),,"I tried to distinguish what the object in the image was first, on my own. If I thought it looked like something but wasn't sure, I looked for that word in the list. If I couldn't even make a guess as to what it was, I looked through each word and tried to ascertain if the image could be the specified word."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"Some of the images were clear. So I had to rely on my personal knowledge and metal rolodex.
Other images were blurred and I used the outline of the image to guess as best as I could.
It did help being able to hover over the photos to figure out the blurred images."
UNINFORMATIVE,,,"I didn't have a strategy, I simply followed the instructions for the harder selections. Some of them were simple to identify while many were not."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,looking for identifiable aspects and using that to base my search on draw directly from memory and analysis.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,Just hovered over the items to see if anything matched or tried to search if I thought I knew what it was
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON & SEARCH,,,I compared ai image with image I searched for and compared those to the image you asked what it was
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,"I used the first couple of results and tried to branch from there, if I thought it was wrong. I felt the further down the list I went, the more inaccurate the results would be"
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,"I use the AI classifier's predictions to see the suggested images and compare them to the task's images. Some were hard to compare, mostly due to the images being blurry or distorted, but I feel like I was able to see some similarities between them. The last one (some type of insect I think) was very difficult because...well I'm afraid of some insects so there's that, but some insects in the suggestions were too similar to the anatomy of the blurred image."
UNINFORMATIVE,,,It was ok but gave too many specific things
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I was trying to focus on the image and then looking at the optiosn to match for the ones I was confused on
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I mostly hovered over the AI suggestions and tried to match the image with images of the suggestions.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"Honestly, most of it was easily recognizable without the use of the AI labels whatsoever. The image of the shopping cart with the ice effect over it was pretty trippy - The Fire Salamander with the ice effect was instantly recognizable.

Where I did collaborate with the AI the most was a couple of the dogs. Irish Wolfhound? EZPZ. Schnauzer looking thing that's cream colored? Oh yeah, I'm relying on my AI friend for a little bit of help determining what's what. "
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,I tried to stick with AI guesses towards the top of the list
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I made a rough guess in my head then looked at the predictions for confirmation.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,"For images that were fairly clear and obvious, I perused the list of AI predictions, and if not found, searh for it.  For images that were blurred or not obvious, I utilized the search results to find a suitable candidate, quickly discarding those that were nonsensical and sifting a few based on specific details."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"If I didn't know the word that the AI classifier's prediction showed, I would hover over it to see an image of it. I used my judgment mostly but if it were blurry, I would hover over words in AI that I didn't know and look at the shapes and COLOR of the object in the image and the object shown by AI to see if there was a close match."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,I looked at the image and then the images of the classifiers to compare and then chose what I thought was the right answer
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"As far as wildlife goes, I knew what most of them were just from the pattern recognition of having seen them many times. If I found it very mysterious, I opened the image in its own tab and zoomed into it, even though the resolution was small. For items like the shopping cart and etc, I opened the categories to make sure there wasn't something more specific, or another label that fit better."
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,"I was at least 75% sure of each picture when I saw it, so I would go through the AI list and see where it placed my first impression. If it was high on the AI list, that's what I went with, unless I was sure it was wrong. For example, the picture of the mink could have been a mink, weasel, or European pole cat to me, so I went with the AI's top choice, the mink, and was correct. What I thought was a wild boar turned out not to be, but that choice was on the list, not prominent but I went with it and was wrong. On the last picture, I didn't agree with the AI's first choice, so I went through until I found one that matched more closely to what I saw, the Dobermann.  Overall, the AI list was helpful when I wasn't sure or needed a hint or two to figure it out."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,most images you could tell by looking at it but somtimes  i used the AI for my correct label
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I looked at the pictue and came up with an image that I thought it may be. Then I took a look at the suggestions.
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,"I thought that since there was a 95% chance that the correct label would be in the AI's list, I looked through the list to see what the image might be. I looked at the pictures next to the label and compared with the one that I needed to label. If I wasn't sure, I picked one out of the list that I thought was the most similar to the image to be identified."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I knew some of them, and the AI helped me figure out what some of the other ones looked like."
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,with that AI is pretty good of telling us
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I had a good idea of what each image was and then I compared it visually with the predictions. If I wasn't sure, I typed ideas into the engine and then made comparisons until something made sense with what I saw and what I believed it could be."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I just did my best to compare the images in the suggestions to the image I was given and make my best match.
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,,I looked closely at the picture and usually the upper left hand first choice was correct
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I looked at the picture first, to see if I recognized it at all. If I did, I would confirm to see if what I thought the item was was on the AI's predictions. If I couldn't tell, I would look at the AI's predictions directly. In both cases, I searched for the item in the search bar to look at the tree of items to search for similar items."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,If I had an idea of what the image was I would look for the corresponding word on the list.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"If i knew what it was i typed it in. If i wasn't sure exactly i picked from the list of words, usually look at the pics and words to see if something clicked."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"It was only helpful when I had no idea. However, some of the photos were so blurred it was hard to know what if was even with the suggestions. For example, I am familiar with a lot of dog breeds because my dogs compete in obedience competitions. And some of the breeds were really hard to label."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"I looked at the image, then looked to see if any of the AI suggestions matched what I was thinking of. I relied heavily on the AI for topics I am not familiar with such as dog breeds, but trusted my own instinct for simple to identify images."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I used my best guess
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,It saved me time in some cases and gave a better guess on things I can't identify.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"Most of the time I just looked at the picture and then at the list, then looked for anything close on the list that may have matched my guess of the picture."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,I took the AI suggestion into consideration but used the image labels to help narrow down what I was looking at. I felt that it was equal parts of my discernment along with what the AI suggested.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,i looked at the image and thought what it was and compared it to the results of ai and looked at ais images
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),"I first tried to guess what it was and then looked to see if that was in the AI list.  I then looked at other similar options in the AI list to see if any of those were closer, especially on the blurry photos.  When I really wasn't sure, I went with the AI option that looked most like the image."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,On some I had a good idea and was able to narrow down my choices by the selections offered. On others I had no idea and viewed all images until I found one I felt correlated.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,For most of the images I knew what it was so I used the AI prediction to put the correct label on. For the couple of images I couldn't figure out what it was I compared the image to the images the AI offered to find one that seemed to match the best
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I just identified the picture myself and used some of the AI tool.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,I would look at what the Al was showing before I would pick what I thought the image was.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,Comparing the images to the images of the AI's predictions were super helpful.
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"Sometimes you could tell what the picture was and then finding it in the list. Other times, it was easy by clicking and comparing the pictures in the list to see what looked the closest. I love dogs and got stumped on the terriers. I did have a Maltese Terrier as one of my furbabies, the dogs show seemed very uncommon and one picture was blurry so hard to see the COLOR and exact shape of tail and head."
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"I checked each of the image previews for the predictions in order to weigh how accurate they were when compared to the target image. Not all of them were useful in terms of the type of object or creature (as an example, it would give me birds and rabbits when the image was of a roof with a cat on it), but it did go a long way towards looking for specific physical features in broader categories. It was extremely helpful when looking for dog breeds and types of lizards based on their appearance."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,On the ones i could not tell what they were i went with the AI. On the obvious ones i went with the AI and then changed it if i did not agree.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I roughly guessed what the image was and looked thru AI photos to refine the guess to a specific species
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,I looked through the AI to see images that were close then made my decision from there.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),"Some of these were tough, and I was surprised the AI could even make predictions that were so close from the image supplied. When I seen the images I tried my best to search my memory for something that seemed familiar, then looked at the AI  suggestions, specifically the first option in the list, then used it side by side with the image to see if I could pick out similarities. I would go through each option in the list, see what images came up, and made my estimations from there."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,sometimes i made names red if i knew they were clearly wrong. otherwise i looked at the images and tried to match key features.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,The classifier was very helpful in giving me a starting point with each image.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,"I assumed that the answer would always be in the list and hovered over the names until I found a picture that matched. Sometimes, I went with my first instinct."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I just looked really good at the photo and did my best and it was not always easy.
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I would use keywords for suggestions and match the blurred image with the images of AI suggestions.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"If I had an idea of what the image was, I'd use the AI classifier to confirm. If I wasn't sure, I'd look through the predictions to see if there was something similar."
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,"Look over the top choices and see if it is obviously one of them. Otherwise, go with the ai's top choice. The ai is much more effective than me at deciphering blurry images."
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I hovered my mouse over the words to see the images and tried to match the images together.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,"I compared the image of each option the AI gave me based on what I thought the image was. The majority of the time, I agreed with one of the top options the AI gave me. I looked at each option of the category once I clicked on the answer, but usually I still chose the answer I was given."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"I would look at the picture and try and figure out what it was on my own. if I had an idea, i would search it. if not, i would see what the ai suggested and look at those pictures. I would then search and look through the tree."
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,I used the AI predictions and hovered over each term to see if the image matched closely enough.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I looked at the image to see what I thought it was, then I looked at the predictive text to see if that was an option. If it was an option, I chose that. If it wasn't an option, I looked through the AI choices to see if any of those better matched the image than what I thought. If the image really wasn't on the list, then I searched by keyword myself."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,A lot of them were obvious. For the ones I wasn't sure about I hovered over the AI predictions to see what most closely resembled the image.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"In a couple of cases, it seemed like the first couple of suggestions contained the accurate label. Otherwise, it was fairly easy to tell based on the common theme of many of the suggestions. For instance, if the suggestions contained a lot of large dog breeds, and the image looks like the dog is big, then it's safe to disregard the suggestions that include small or medium dog breeds."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"If I thought I knew what the picture was portraying then I simply looked for the word in the prediction. If it was there then great. If not, then I went through each prediction to see if it matched."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I made my best guess and then let AI provide choices that were close to my prediction.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,looked at the pictures generated from the ai's suggestions til I found a match
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,"AI was very useful for a few that I really could not tell at all what it was, and a few when I would search for what I thought it was, there weren't even any results for it, so the predictions helped me have an idea, and I would see the lists and go ""Oh yeah, I guess it is"" and use it's predictions, so it was very useful."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,i just went through all the ais predictions and tried to match the best one
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"Many of the items I already knew what they were, the ones I wasn't sure about, I would then use the AI, to get an idea of what it might be."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH,,"1) I knew what the image was. I looked for the name in the listing.
2) I thought I knew what the image was. I looked for the name in the listing. I then used the search to see images of closely related objects to make sure I was happy with my answer. 
3) I didn't know what the image was and used the listing and hover over to see the images. 
4) Sometimes, I had to guess. There was a bird shown a barn. Both Barn and many birds were shown. I assumed that the bird was the intent of the image. I did not get that correct, so maybe it was the barn. 
5) When I had no idea, I used the images and then searched to see if I could make a better guess. "
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,I tried to figure out what the image could be and then look for related words
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,Some images were easy but others I would squint to try and see the image more clearly. I also hovered over predictions in the event I was unsure and needed a better idea of what I was viewing.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,I tried to come up with what it was on my own first and then I checked my idea against the list. I looked at a lot of pictures to compare as well
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH,,"I searched the AI's recommendations for an object that I believed looked similar, then I compared the photos."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,Occasionally I utilized the AI classifier to predict what the image was. Most of the time I relied on what I knew it was.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,I checked the list at the right to see if anything looked like a match for the picture if the picture was blurred or bad.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,SEARCH,"Generally speaking, I'd use the AI suggestions first, especially if the image was rather difficult to make out. If the AI suggestions were not what I felt was accurate for what I was seeing in each image, I'd usually then either click one of the suggestions for a sub category, or use the search function in order to narrow it down to what I felt I was seeing."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"Common sense and then I perused to see if my immediate thought was listed. additionally, if it was something I was completely unsure of then I immediately consulted the AI suggestions."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I looked at each image and tried to first make my own guess on what was pictured, then I checked to see if that was included in the AI's predictions. If there wasn't anything close to my guess, I went through each listed item one by one and selected the label that seemed to match the best."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,Followed gut instincts
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,Looked for similar pictures to the AI classifier's predictions and the environment surrounding the object to further scrutinize it.
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,I trusted the AI
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"If I recognized the object, I looked for that in the list. If I didn't recognize it, I scanned the list looking for something likely."
SEARCH,HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,I tried to narrow search parameters according to what I believed the image to be.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,Just looked through the classifiers and see which one matched the best based off my interpretation of the image
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I viewed every option there was available and compared them to each other until I found the image that was close to the target.
"
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,,"At first I tried to determiner myself, but quickly realized the AI was an excellent guide, so I went through the generated list carefully, focusing on the top predictions, which yielded good results."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,ELIMINATION,,I tried to briefly check each image in the AI suggestions and eliminate things that didn't seem like a match.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,AI helped me with the general area that the answer was in. I don't think I would have nearly got as many right as I did without the AI suggestion. I can't even really remember one time getting an answer right outside of it's suggestions. I would definitely pay for AI to help me.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,i watch them attentively and predicted the best way that i could
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S) ,DISAPPOINTED AT AI,,i followed the 95% heavily but it didnt pay off.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,"Honestly, I just went through all the choices that were given to me by the AI, and just chose the one that I thought closely matched the picture."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I first looked at the image without looking at the suggestions. If my thought was in the list, it made it the obvious choice. If not, I would compare the listed pictures with the target pictures of the ones that seemed closest. I trusted the AI more with the clear pictures, but the really blurry ones were just as challenging for it as it was me."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,The first thing I looked fr in the AI classifier's predictions were the categories then narrow that category down by seeing and choosing which fit best.
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,"If I could tell what the picture was, I looked for the label on the list. If I couldn't find it in the list, I typed in the answer to see if that would bring up an option, but it usually didn't, and I had to go with the closest thing I could find on the list. If I couldn't tell what the picture was well enough, I hovered on likely items in the list to see if the pictures matched, and tried to pick the closest-looking one."
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,,I looked at the top prediction and the picture for the prediction.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I had to really look at and enhance the image. Then I looked on the list to see if something similar was on it.I squinted my eyes and tried to see what I thought with the outlines of images. I looked at almost every image that the AI had. I could not see anything on one of the pictures close to the end. I could only see a cartoon image of an elephant's face and trunk, with a shower cap on and a stuffed animal monkey on his shoulder. I spent so much time on that one trying to see something different, but I couldn't so I guessed monkey."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I thought of what it looked like, then I hovered over the words to get the pictures, then I tried to match it to the best of my ability."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,Sometimes I knew the image. If I did not I used AI help to compare pictures.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH,,"I tried to see if I knew what the image was before looking at the AI prediction or having a general idea of what the image was before looking at the AI prediction. If I saw the AI listed the same identification, I selected that. If not, I decided if the correct identification was another one of the AI's prediction. If nothing looked like it was correct from the AI, I did a manual search."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,The AI Classifier was more helpful than attempting to figure out what the image was on my own; its recommendations were more thorough. So I clicked on what I thought the image was and then searched through the suggestions until I was satisfied with making a final choice.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI PREDITCION(S),,I based on the AI predictions.  I did not know some of the images so I was much dependent on AI
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,i looked for the word that i knew/thought it was then compared the pictures to what i was seeing
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"I used the AI classifier's predictions as a way of ruling out what any image could or could not be. Combined with my own brain, I only got one wrong."
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,I previewed each plausible AI prediction and chose the one that most closely matched the image.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,ELIMINATION,,compared the words to what the image might be then eliminated the ones i thought it couldnt be
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I looked at the AI predictions for things I did not know.  If nothing looked correct, or if I already knew what the object was but it wasn't listed, then I would type search for what I felt was the correct answer."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I hovered over the options and tried to decide which looked the closest to the image.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I first attempted to identify what I thought the image was. Then I went thought the AI classifier's prediction to find the closest match. If I thought more than one option could fit I looked for more details in the image to find the best match.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,I went through every AI suggested categories and tried to closely match the resulted image to the image on display.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,I looked at the AI suggestions for words I recognized that resembled what I thought I saw in the image. If I didn't see one I recognized on the AI's list I would search for a word to see additional options.
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),DISAPPOINTED AT AI,,"I don't think it was that easy, I don't think the AI was all that accurate. I had to look around a few times to find the best match."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"I. First, I look at the image and try to recognize the main object or scene that it depicts. I also pay attention to the details, such as the color, shape, size, texture, and context of the object or scene. For example, if the image shows a red fruit with a green stem and a round shape, I might think of an apple.

II. Second, When the image is blurry, I compare my initial guess with the AI classifier‚Äôs prediction. The AI classifier is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to analyze the image and suggest a possible label for it. The AI classifier‚Äôs prediction is based on an extensive database of images and labels that it has learned from.

III. Third, I use my own knowledge and research skills to verify or refine my initial guess and the AI classifier‚Äôs prediction. 

IV. Fourth, I choose the most appropriate and accurate label for the image based on my judgment and reasoning."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,SEARCH,"I mainly went with my first instinct when identifying the images but, if I wasn't sure or had absolutely no idea, then I got guidance by either searching for images or using the AI Classifier prediction"
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,I just approximated the image and looked to see if the AI was close to what I imagined.
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,Usually the very first prediction was correct. However it was not correct I would have to type in the word myself as it was not one of the predictions.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,Utilized the tools given and visual cues.
SEARCH,,,I identified the category the object would lie in and then cross referenced that category tree with the AIs selections.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I chose to rely on my own interpretation of the images shown to figure out the best option.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I tried to get an idea of what it is I was looking at first. I then looked at the list and scrolled through the words I thought might be close and looked at the image. I then narrowed it down to the word and image combination that I thought matched the picture.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I used that the AI gave me as suggestions and then tried to figure out what the image might be from what I knew of the images as well
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"First, I tried to identify the object myself. Then, I compared my guess with the list of predictions, and selected the closest one."
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,,looked at their top choices and then still made my own decisions.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,"I tried to decide what I thought it was and then looked for the names. Many times I was correct. If I didn't know, I just looked at the pictures of the words I didn't recognize to see if I could figure it out. I wasn't very successful at that."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),ELIMINATION,"For many of the images I already had an idea of what the image was.  I hovered over the labels in the list to see if it matched what the item was.  A couple of items had me stumped so I used process of elimination such as ""is the item an animal."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,"I just went through the predictions and did my best to try to do a visual match with the image. This was difficult because sometimes the original image was blurred. I guess it was nice that the AI had identified some possible options for me to look at. Some, I honestly could not have begun to guess, did I not have the AI options available. So I guess AI was helpful, but I did not get all 100%. The only thing that was helpful for me was the visual images. The subject headings or sub-heads did not help me at all. So maybe AI is helpful for some things, not as helpful in others."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,I compared the image to what I thought it looked like then looked through the results and picked the closest match
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),"I first tried to name the object by myself without looking at the suggested labels.  Then I reviewed the labels looking for one that matched my guess.  The AI prediction was particularly helpful with the animals and insects because I didn't necessarily know their names.  I reviewed the lists given and didn't bother clicking on the ones that I could obviously eliminate, like inanimate objects when I'm looking for an animal, etc.  I tried looking for any distinguishing features and used that strategy to help me find the best match.  I also looked for the general shape & color of the items to help me guess."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),"A good 2/3rds of the images were relatively easy to identify without the help of the AI. The rest, the AI's suggestions were often very reliable and helped confirm what I thought the image could have been. Their suggestions were indeed very helpful. Additionally, for the spanier question I relied heavily on the searchbar, looking at the results and comparing the images of the dogs."
