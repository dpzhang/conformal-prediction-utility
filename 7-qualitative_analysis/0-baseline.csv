THEME I,THEME II,THEME III,Strategy
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,,I tried to identify the best I could then drill down to find the best result. It was very tough though.
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,got to the category and then looked at pictures to try to decide
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"First, I tried to guess what it was with a good degree of certainty. If that didn't work, I search for keywords (e.g. color (black), environment (desert)), and if that didn't work I tried to narrow down what group the animal or scene belonged to."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,I tried to figure out what I thought it was at first and then narrow it down with the options available in the search
SEARCH,,,"I'm sick today, so I didn't do as well as I might have. I tried to look at the categories and the pictures to find a match."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,I went through the different images in the search function to find the closest looking image to what was shown for me to identify. I also used my knowledge to identify what was in the image.
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,"Tried my best at seeing what the image was, put in a keyword and then looked at the pictures given to see if I could find it"
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,,"Unless I was certain, I used the chart by putting in what I thought it might be and following the chart, sometimes backing up to the very beginning."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,Did my best to figure out what in the world this was.
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,I thought tree of options was the most helpful to use. First I tried to think of the general category of what was shown in the picture then use the tree to check the possibilities. I compared the choices to what was shown in the image until I found one that looked most like the image.
SEARCH,,,"When the object was something that could be categorized more specifically I would use the branching out search function, like the different dog breeds. If the item was straightforward, like the harmonica, it was easier just to type in the exact name of it then click on it in the search function."
SEARCH,,,I just searched what I believed each thing to be. There were a few that I just had no idea.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"If the image was immediately discernable, I would type out the word and click it. If it was questionable, I would type the general category (such as snake), then look at the images to find the best match. Some images could not be identified, so I guessed based on the color."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,I went thru and eliminated what I thought it was.
SEARCH,,,I used the search if I didn't know a specific breed or what it was called.
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,Looking at the pictures
UNINFORMATIVE,,,
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"I simply tried to be as accurate as I possibly could when making classifications, and when I was stumped, I made my best possible guess using the search results provided."
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,Some images were clear and i tried to search and find the closest match. Other images were not so clear and i had to guess what they were and find a similar item in the search
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,most of the words I would use weren't even in the database.
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,"I tried to do a generic name of the object, but I needed to be more specific. Sometimes I thought it was a certain object, but the word was not in the database."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,"all guessing, the pictures were hard to see for me."
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I tried to make out what the image was if it wasn't clear. I searched for categories and when through the choices that best fit and tried to base it off the images.
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I used the tree system to try to find the answer by guessing what the image was and then going through the pictures of the options I had available. Then I picked the one I thought was closest. It made it difficult for guesses of dogs and things like that because the pictures provided to guess from weren't always clear and a lot of dog breeds have similar features especially when categorized on similarities like they are in the tree.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,I just went with my best guess then used the search for something in the vicinity of it. As I familiarized myself with the tree/branching I did use some category keywords in some searches to get in the ballpark of what I was trying to find.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I tried to look up everything, but the pictures were not matching, so I had to guess on several."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,I just guessed the keywords for a lot of them and tried comparing each as best I could.
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,"I tried to identify either the item itself or something close to it. For example, I was looking for oral syringe or something under medicine administration. The closest I found was syringe, so I entered it. It was correct."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,I tried to identify what each image was. If I wasn't sure I would guess. I would then use the hierarchy to narrow my search and look at each image to match what I thought was in the image.
COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,,,I tried to look at the image COLOR and and the COLOR of the the animal or object in the photo and search for them based on what I knew had those COLOR. I also tried to search for object based on surrounding information in the photos like environment and determined the likely hood of whether or not the object or animal usually occupies that environment
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I tried to rely on my knowledge of animals
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,Whenever I had an idea of what something might be I would type in the most general vocabulary to use the library and narrow it down based off the options inside the categories.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I tried to guess as closely as I could to what the images might be, which was difficult because many of the images were blurred unnecessarily, so I simply guess something so as to not waste time. Some of the terminology used for the images was not familiar to me, so once again, I  also tried to simply guess as closely as i could. Altogether, after placing a generalized guess, I tried to pinpoint an exact match. Lastly, I also performed online searches of the images in a few cases, in order to try and find alternate pictures that might help me to pinpoint my guess in order to allow it to be more exact. This worked once or twice."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,I used the second option and typed in the answer and digram that leads to the answer
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I got too many dogs, of different breads which I was by no means an expert on, so I had to guess. Even with so many images on hand. Most of the rest seemed trivial. I didn't really have a particular strategy other than goggling other results."
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I looked for identifiable features that i could search, and then used the reference images to get more specific results"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),"sometimes it was as simple as having a clear image and using my preexisting knowledge to identify it (like a Polar bear). When the image had noise or filters, the process was finding its outline, color, and surroundings to build a context. Then I used keywords and the imageNet Tree to search for the closest guess."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,I tried to find keywords and then a picture when searching that best fit the picture I was identifying
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,,"For some of them, I recognized at least a type or category to go from. I went back to the most generic terminology I could think of, and utilized the ""search tree"" to narrow down the results. There were a couple, however, that were (in my opinion) completely unrecognizable so I just guessed."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I would search what I think is roughly the right answer, as in dog or lizard, etc.. I then would use the tree tool and scan through looking for pictures that looked as close as possible."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I entered the most general term into the search I could imagine that still accurately represented what I thought the thing was (if I could ever discern anything at all) and then scrolled through the representative pictures in the hierarchy until I found something that looked as similar as possible to the thing in the image. This worked better for the live organisms than for static objects.
SEARCH,,,"I tried to discern what was the main focus and search what came up, if nothing was I would go on to the next object and then on."
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,,"I would think of the broadest term to describe the object then, search that word to narrow down the object."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,doing my best to find what the image could be. Scrolling over options to see if the pictures were similiar
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I first attempted to identify the category of what appeared in the image based of my knowledge. I typed in the general term for it and went through the hierarchical tree of labels in that category in an attempt to locate an image that resembled the photo.
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,I look up different keywords that would associate with the thing in the pic.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I just tried my best to make out what the image was
UNINFORMATIVE,,,"i have no idea, trying my hardest"
UNINFORMATIVE,,,Alot of these were hard. I know many dog breeds and some of those were hard to identify.
SEARCH,,,I would type what closely matched the picture and do a full search. I would look at all the branches of options and take a look at all the pictures and pick the one closest to what i though matched the original picture.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,"very hard, no good strategy"
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,"I went with my original suspicion of what it could be, then did a semi-vague search to see if there was an option that backed that up (enter ""dog"", then narrow it down). If I was positive I knew what the image was, I entered as specific a search as possible. On the few images that I had no idea, I entered possibilities to try and narrow it down. For example, one near the end I was clueless on and thought it could be either an elephant or a squid. Neither squid nor octopus came up in the search so I went with Asian elephant."
SEARCH,,,I tried to focus on what item(s) I saw and made my best guess based off my available search options.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"Some of them I already knew. Some of them I had to search, and usually had to try multiple search words. Some of them I had no idea what they were, because the pictures were too obscured, and had to just guess and try to find a word that the program would accept. Some of them I had to choose something I did not think was correct because the program was very limited. I didn't have any other strategy I used every time, in part because I could not find what I wanted several times. I don't really understand what you were actually testing here, because I don't see how using the (poor) search helps when you have made the items in the picture unidentifiable."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"If I knew what it was I typed in the name.  If I didn't I tried a few possible options to see what was in the database.  When I couldn't find any plausible options, I just picked something which seemed vaguely close."
COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,,,I tried to make out the surroundings or silhouette of the object.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"I generally knew what the images were, and the search feature helped immensely. I know I didn't get them all right, and the blurry ones were nearly impossible to get. I guessed on some."
UNINFORMATIVE,,,There wasn't no specific strategy. Just tried to look at the image and examine it the best as I could.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,At least half the images where not in the data base
UNINFORMATIVE,,,Most of them were identifiable to me. There were a few Captcha style ones which was too abstract to really identify but I tried to be specific.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"I first tried to make a guess as to what I was looking at, then tried to confirm it via the search option. If that didn't work, I tried something general, like animal or mammal, and tried to narrow things down that way. Ultimately, it came down to making an informed guess as to what I was looking at."
COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,,,I discerned color and size then drew on my own understanding of animal life.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,"Just by looking at the image, however a few of the selected images were blurry, out of focus or so desaturated that they were hard to identify so it was a crapshoot. Or they had no defining characteristics at all, which made guessing pointless."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,By picking objects in mind that I knew looked similar to the image. I took a wild guess approach to some of the images that were faded out and the answers weren't apparent.
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,Type in what it reminded me of and look at what the options were
SEARCH,SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,Searching for the category of animal or object. Then narrowing it down looking at the branches of different available specific types.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,It was very hard with a lot of them so I didn't really have a strategy. I tried to outline things though.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,nothing
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"To be honest, if I didn't recognize it within the first 5 seconds of looking, I wouldn't recognize it at all. The spreadsheet provided images for various options but it never helped me to recognize what the image I was trying to identify contained."
SEARCH (BY DROPDOWN),,,"I used the word completion to get the general category of an item, then used the image tree to find similar images and remind myself of potential possibilities."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,"I didn't think using the keyword search would help a lot, but it surprisingly aided in me looking for things I otherwise wouldn't know the name for. I'd put down the vague keyword (i.e. spider) and then look through the database."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,comparing images to my first thought of what the image was and checking to see if they were the same or different.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I tried to identify the image. If I could immediately find the word I would just search for the specific word. If not, I would use the keyword web and try to see if I could match up images."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I decided what the main category was (ex. dog, beetle, etc) and then used the search bar and moved my mouse over the different options until I found one that looked the most similar"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"Some I knew the specific image right away, such as the Doberman dog. Some I knew the general category but had to look through the options for the specifics and then choose which best fit, such as the grouse and the newt. Some I had no idea what the object was and tried to find anything in the image that might be familiar, and then look through the options to see if anything stuck out as a possible fit."
SEARCH (BY DROPDOWN),,,I just looked at phrases that described what I thought it might have been.
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,i just tried to see the image and entered in what I thought it was in the search and picked the closet I could find
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"some i knew already, some i used what i knew or descriptive words to help figure it out"
SEARCH BY KEYWORD,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I would search up anything that I could make out of the picture. If I could only see leafs then I would search up "" leafs"" and hope that something that looks similar to the image would show. If I could tell what it was but didnt know they exact word, I would look up something basic like ""dog"" and then look at the images that were provided in tree"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,I am very familiar with animals. I just typed in the closest word or the most similar family of animals that had to do with the image I saw. I then compared the picture to the images that were available.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I tried to guess as correctly as possible without searching the drop down menu because it was overwhelming
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"Many of them were difficult- I tried to think of a word that was closest to what I was seeing and then look at the pictures for each. Some were easy enough that I just knew the answer without having to search. Some I couldn't tell at all and just tried to think if I was explaining the image to someone that couldn't see it, what would I say?- and then go from there."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"For the images I was unsure about, I tried to search for the general category that I thought it might be in (e.g. ""machine"", ""dog"", ""insect"") and then looked at each picture around that category to try to find the best match."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,Attempting to get close to the item or category and then using the photos
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I thought of what category the image might fall into and searched that word in the ImageNet, then I scrolled through the example images to see what fit best"
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I used the search function to look at pictures until I found something I thought matched.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"I went with my gut, especially with the more distorted images. I tried to use the search to narrow down what I was not certain about. The purple flower (?) was the most frustrating and I think the image changed from a flower to a fish to a butterfly as I tried to decipher it."
SEARCH (BY DROPDOWN),,,I typed in what I thought it would be & choose from the list
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I just tried to guess as clsoe a spossible
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I typed in what I thought the object might be, then looked at the photos that came up in the tree branches to see if anything looked similar. I also used my personal experience from having seen the objects before."
COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,Noticing any identifying features and searching for similar images and then looking at the surroundings in the image if that was not successful.
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I chose to search for words that I thought were similar enough to the object. I used the flowchart as an aid for all of them because even if I was wrong in my initial thought, it would show me things related to it."
COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,,,I just looked for context clues when it was too blurry and went from there. A few of them I had zero clue though.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,"If I was very confident what it was, I would search it right away. Otherwise, I would use the tree to try to find the right label and compare it to the picture. I did very poorly and often could not find what I was looking for. If I couldn't figure it out, I picked something I knew was wrong but was relatively close or a random guess."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I examined the pictures and took my best guess
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,"My study for identifying the correct labels was thinking about a few topics or things I thought they could be, searching for it, and seeing if I could then find the right things (sometimes in a related category). However, this task was pretty hard but fun. Sometimes I would see other category names nearby and click into them that way."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,"first i hoped i had a clue what it was and i typed that name and then searched to find the matching item. If i had no clue, i guessed what it could be and guessed again. I guess im not a good guesser!"
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,Some or most of them I had absolutely no clue what they were. When I kind of knew I would change the keyword until I saw it.
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,,"I just tried to figure out what category of things that are living-ish on the planet, and find a section for that and look at pictures. some pictures I had no idea on earth what they were and totally winged it because I had no idea what they were."
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"For the most part, I simply tried to make my best guess, scrolled through the available options for what I typed in, and then looked those up on Google until I got a match. I did not always get a match, and when I didn't I attempted a Google image search, but the few times I did did not help me out much. If I can't make the image out then Google can't either I suppose."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,Some were very easy and did not require any strategy. The harder ones I would input what I thought it was and then bring up the outline thing. I would search through each photo and try to find a similar picture.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,"My strategy was squinting really hard and going ""Okay so my vision is either worse than I thought or better than I thought"" and going off vibes."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,If I already felt like I new what it was I would start typing in the keyword until I found the word I was looking for. If I had no clue or a word didn't come up that I thought it was I would then do a best guess for key word and then hit search go through all the possibilities and look at photos. Some of those I thought I was able to get but for most of them I just did a best guess or a shot-in-the-dark guess
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,Many of the image labels were looking for a specific species type. I searched first entering the most basic one keyword label for an image. I then used the expansive index to refine my keyword to an exact specification most matching based upon the image examples.
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I liked the picture search, so I put in one word like lizard and then look at the different pictures to identify it."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,I just tried to figure out the best I could what the image would be and tried to find a word that corresponded with my best guess. Some were extremely blurry or hard to figure out at all.
COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,,,"Some photos were much too blurry to make sense of. Almost like with a Rorschach test, I just tried to determine what it looked like to me if I was having difficulties. I also relied on COLOR. When there was a lack of color, I just put in something random."
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I thought about what something looked like. Certain pictures were easy, others were a little more difficult. I thought about it and would type something into the bar, and look for similar pictures within the tree library. Once I settled on something, I chose it and submitted it as my answer."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,Using the pictures from the tree
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,i entered in what i thought it was. for the harder ones i used a general search term and tried to look the tree hovering over the text for images. i did my best to select which ones looked like it
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,I tried my best to narrow it down by searching anything I could think of that related to the image
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I tried to go with my gut instinct
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES IMAGES,,"I pretty much always used the images you get when mousing over a link.

I always used the tree. I never searched, chose an item from the suggestions, and just went with that. I'd always go to the tree after picking something.

Sometimes I had a pretty good idea of what I was looking for so just searched for it and narrowed it down in the tree.

A few times I had no idea so I just started with the beginning of the tree and and used the categories to narrow it down. Sometimes it helped that round and I was able to sort it out. Sometimes it helped in subsequent rounds because it made me aware of what was available (like both lizards and salamanders being options).

Once I didn't know what you wanted. There was a cat and a bird on a roof and I couldn't find an exact match.

I think that's about it.

Good luck with your research! :)"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"I tried to determine which each object was, then I used the search to try to find it."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,"Honestly I didn't have a solidified strategy, just trying to work off my best guess and find something more similar in the options tree"
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"If I had a good idea of what it was, I typed it out to see if it popped up. If it was an animal that I knew generally what kind, but maybe not the exact name, I searched for a name I could think of that was close and then compared the pictures. For other things, I spent a lot of time clicking on different categories and subcategories to see if anything would come up that might make sense."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,"For most rounds I just typed in what I thought it was and hoped there was a category matching, if there wasn't then I would try a keyword and comb through hoping to find what I was looking for."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,"I used the search tool combined with my own knowledge of what the object might've been already. Then navigated the web of results for the answers. Some of them were more difficult than others, as I only made $2.75 in bonuses instead of the entire $4.00. It was actually fun!"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I just did my best to guess what it was and infer from the images in the labeling tree what it could be.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I would first guess what category, type that in and hit search, then look at the images and guess what looked the closest. Unfortunately I was unable to see all the ""trees"" of information so even after closing some of the ""branches"" I don't believe I saw all of the choices."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,I tried to pick the closest thing to what I thought the image was
SEARCH,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I searched for the name of what I thought the image looked like. I chose the name that had a similar reference photo.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I watched the image carefully and identify it.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"Sometimes I could recognize the image right away and I just had to experiment with the flowcart of keywords to find the correct term. Sometimes it was frustrating because I was sure I knew what it was, but there was no option for me to choose the term I was looking for. If the image was too blurry or abstract I just did my best to guess."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,"having a general idea, then looking through the reference images in the hierarchy."
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,,"I typically searched whatever my gut instinct was and then scrolled around in the hierarchy system until I found something I thought worked. If I couldn't find the specific term/word I was looking for, I'd revisit the image and try to come up with a different option for what it could be."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,I just tried a couple keywords to narrow down the specific species/breed.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,I tried to narrow it down based on just looking at the picture and using keywords.  From there I used the drop down menu.  I did not like the tree method.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I tried zooming in. This was extremely difficult.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"Used the first thought that came to mind.  If that didn't work, tried to think a level or two higher in the hierarchy."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,i just tried to figure out the image the best i could even though some of them were unclear
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,closely looking at picture and making guesses based on shape.
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,I would look at the preview images to see if they were what I was looking for.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I just did try to put together what the image was in my head and guess at it.
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,"If I wasn't sure, I would look at the decision tree to see if there is a more specific match and/or similar picture"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,strategy was first my best guess and then utilizing the image search tool to compare what i thought it was with what answers we're populating.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,"This was hard. No strategy, just guessing"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"Most of the one's I got correct I could identify, others I made a best guess from the drop down list. The one's I got wrong I either guessed wrong or in a few cases had no idea at all what it was so those were wild guesses."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"Some of them I just took a guess. Others were somewhat apparent. The last one, the Doberman, just came into focus after struggling with it for a minute or two. I used the search tool a lot otherwise I would still be working on it."
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,What it most closely resembled.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,There was no strategy that worked.  Most images seemed to be things I might see in a dream.  No clear definition.
SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,,"tried to see picture at different angles and sizes, some were very vague. In some (like the hound type dog), I followed the tree to the end and hovered over each example to try to find the right one. In most, I felt confident I knew what it was and the search led straight to the end of the tree."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"If I knew what it was immediately, I wrote in the answer. If not, I used broad categories to narrow down the search (e.g., ""fruit"" or ""dog"")."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"I tried to use the search engine, but most of my successes were due to me recognizing what was in the image from previous experience."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,"Well if the filter overlaying it wasn't too overbearing, I would try to go off the closest thing I could recognize generally. Whether I saw an animal or a place or an object. Most answers I got correct I already knew the correct answer and needed no searching."
SEARCH,,,Using the search tree and looking at the images for a match.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,SEARCH,,just by guessing and searching they were hard some were really blurry and could not make them out as good
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,,"For the things I knew, (reptiles mostly) I just searched the category, then searched for the specific species. So a picture of a newt means I searched ""newt"" then went through the species and images provided for that category. Things I didn't know, like the boat, meant I just searched ""boat"" and then went through all of the listings that showed up until I found the correct one. And some others, such as the fig, were just a guess."
