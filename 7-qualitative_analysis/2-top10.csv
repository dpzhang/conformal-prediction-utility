AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TOP PREDICTION FALLACY,,"It almost felt like gambling since the AI classifier either had the correct answer at the top or none at all. I think one round the correct answer was in the bottom half but otherwise I had to try to figure out what was in a double exposed or blurry image myself. In the latter cases, the AI was completely wrong."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TOP PREDICTION FALLACY,,"I tried to determine if I thought that the AI top choices were reasonable.   If they were reasonable, then I added them to my ""short"" list.  If they weren't reasonable, then I ignored the AI input and focused on my own assessment."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I went through the AI classifier's predictions by hovering. I then chose the image that I felt most closely resembled the photo.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,
UNINFORMATIVE,,,Your AI is next to useless. Sorry.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I looked closely, then examined my options. If I really wasn't sure I then would weigh in on the AI predictions."
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"On the most obvious choices, I typed the word in. On the ones I was not confident or had no idea about, I clicked on the choices on the right and the related choices and went down multiple hierarchies until I found the choice that looked the closet to correct according to the picture."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,TOP PREDICTION FALLACY,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,I usually tried to figure out what the image was and then I would look at the ai to see what was similar. If I still struggled then I would go for the highest predictor that made the most sense with the original image.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I first tried to figure out what it was myself.  Then I looked at the AI.  If I saw things that were close to what I thought, I hovered over the text for a picture to confirm it.  If it lined up, I selected that.  If it didn't, I would look in similar categories.  A few times, I did my own keyword search and tried to find pics that looked similar."
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,,I used the reference images under the AI's suggestions for items that weren't clear to me.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,Look at the pictures in the AI suggestions and try to match it if I did not already know what it was.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,TOP PREDICTION FALLACY,Things I wasn't too sure of like the different birds I let the AI and top rated pick. The ship wreck though I knew it wasn't an animal of any kind
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,I used the A1 classifier's prediction to try to match the image and then I try searching for additional images if the first set of images were not a close match. I then chose what I thought was the most relevant image answer.
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,,"Some were too blurry. I picked what was there because I wasn't sure, but in some cases, the correct answer wasn't available."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,If I was unsure of what the image was I used the AI's predictions to get a general idea. From there I would branch off and look at a multitude of different options using the label space. It was a great tool for getting an idea of what certain things looked like if I've never seen them before. After I had seen a few different options I would carefully look at the image to see if I could notice any similarities at all between it and the reference images I could find in the label space.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I went by what I believed it to be first, and then compared it to the AI. If we didn't match, I went a couple times with the AI, but once they were proven wrong, I went by my own guess."
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,"If iI was not sure what the item was, I looked at the predictions to see which one would possibly match the item."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I just used the AI predictions for the sub-items on some of them
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,,I looked at the same color on a lot of the things.  I used AI on all of them except one and I was wrong anyway.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,"I first examined the photo carefully. Some were very easy to identify, like the polar bear, or I got an idea of what they might be. Next, I looked at the AI's list. Some were possible contenders, especially where I didn't have a clue right away what photo showed. I used some of the most likely AI suggestions, and also the search box and ""drilling down"" the categories."
UNINFORMATIVE,,,"some of the images were pretty clear, but some of these were confusing to look at like the grey fox. no strategy just looking at the image"
UNINFORMATIVE,,,
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,"I viewed the images first and made up my mind on what they could be, then looked at the AI's choices on the right. The AI almost always had the correct answer bar a few examples. It was very good to use and helped a lot in making my decision."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,"I looked through the images that the AI recommended and tried to find the best one. Rarely, I'd search for what I thought it was. The AI prediction was pretty dependable, but for the images that were blurred or hard to see, not as much."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"For images that I had no idea what they could be I relied on AI to help me decide on an answer. On images I was sure about, it made me more confident in my choice seeing if AI had selected it too."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I would check the AI list first to see if anything matched up with the image, if it did I would select that option. If nothing matched or I couldn't tell what the image was, I would start searching for what I think the image might be, or browsing images in the category I thought the image might be in."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,I first checked the AI predictions to see if there was a visual match. If I didn't see a visual match in the AI's predictions i searched by keyword and then worked my way back from there if I still didn't find a visual match. A couple of times I had to use the keyword search feature and then work my way back through the hierarchy of labels to find the closest looking match.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,"I just did what I felt was right at the moment, no strategy"
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,I would look at the suggestions the AI gave and see if the image associated with the word matched with picture. Many times it was hard to determine due to the picture quality or not being familiar enough with animal species. Many times I had to just go with the top suggestion due to lack of knowledge.
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I used the AI for anything I was unsure about - specific breeds of animal, extremely blurry images and so on. When I was pretty sure I recognized something, I just typed it in instead. The AI seemed pretty good at categorizing species, but I'm not sure it was any better than me with blurry stuff."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I looked at the image from small to large and studied the predictions.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,I used my brain.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I tried to give my best guess based on the visual clarity of the image.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),TOP PREDICTION FALLACY,I often went with one of the AI's predictions although it was not always the top prediction. I used google image search for those I was not sure of to get an idea of what the AI's predictions were supposed to look like without all the blurriness.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,I would first look at the image and see what I thought it was. I would then look at the AI list and see if it was on there. If I knew I was right I would type and search. If the AI had it in the top ten I would just choose that answer.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I guessed what the AI suggested most of the time.  A few times it was way off and made my own prediction.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,"I matched my initial thoughts with the probability of each of the AI's predictions. For example, I was 99% sure that one of the images was of a pelican and yet there were no matching AI predictions; so I chose my prediction, which was correct. There were images that were to distorted for me to even guess or have an initial prediction. So, for those images, I chose the AI's highest probability prediction."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I used my own personal knowledge of what i was seeing but i also used the AI to help when i was stumped. It helped quite a bit on the ones i was stumped on. I would say it was about 50% accurate when i got stuck on images.
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,,"The Classifier's prediction often clashed with what was an acceptable response, so I entered the top Classifier's prediction (when it matched the example images) into the text box to avoid the error."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I mostly relied on my previous knowledge and used the AI suggested pictures to corroborate.
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,,"when i had no idea what the image was, I used the AI"
SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"When I was immediately able to identify what was in the image, I mostly searched for it with keywords rather than go with the AI prediction. When the subject was harder to identify, or I wasn't quite sure of specifics, I would start looking at the AI predictions. I would also check other items within the same group in the hierarchy. The less certain I was, the more I would defer to its choices."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,body features helps me decide
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,If I didn't know what it was I used AI top guess
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,"I used a mix of my own and the AI's instincts and surprisingly, the AI was fairly spot on at points where I didn't think it would be. So I found myself trusting the AI a bit more as the study went on."
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),SEARCH BY LABELS,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),"I looked at AI's prediction rankings first, in order. If none of these seem to match the image, then I'll look at the closest related image and see the other related labels, or I'll just use the search tab with keywords I can infer from the image."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,I looked at the selection of choices and then looked at the image to see if anything closely matched the image. If I didn't feel the selection offered the correct choice I would then enter what I thought the image could possibly be in the search bar.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,TOP PREDICTION FALLACY,ELIMINATION,"I pulled from my knowledge I already knew and also used the hover over words to see pictures. Often this helped me. If I did not know the picture, I used my best guess to rule out if it was the first AI answer or not."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"For things I knew immediately, I just went off of what the picture was. For things and animals I couldn't recognize, I referred to the AI's recommendation and used the pictures as reference to make my best guesses. For the ones I didn't really know, I just guessed based on the shape or silhouette of the object or thing."
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"i would first check the highest percentage prediction, then i would hover over similar things in that category to compare with the image."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"Some of the images I could clearly tell what they were so on those I ignored the AI's predictions.  On some of them I had no idea what the images were and on those I looked through the AI's suggestions and could figure it out from there.  On others, even with the AI's suggestions, I couldn't come up with an answer, on those I took the AI's highest percentage suggestion."
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,"In the cases where I could not remotely tell what I was looking at, I defaulted to the AI's prediction. Otherwise, I would try to figure out what it was I was looking at first, then check the list of options, and pick the one that seemed the most likely."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I mostly went with what the AI said unless I felt very differently. I should have gone with it more looking back actually.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"i tried to think of something and if i couldn't find think of the label, i used the images given from the AI to match"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I tried to guess for myself without the help of the AI at first, and then used the AI as a sort of ‚Äúdouble check.‚Äù"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"In most cases, I had some idea what it was, but I used the AI images to narrow down a specific breed. In other cases, I had no idea, and used the AI images to try to pin down a guess."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"Looking at the AI recommended categories, clicking on them and going through the web of closely related choices."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH,,I first tried to identify without looking at the AI. Then I looked at the AI see how close I was. If nothing feels right I'd do a search to see other option.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,I tried to take the imagine in and thing as the AI would when studying it. I feel I got a few right with this model.
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,"If I didn't know the name for something it was best. There was one which I thought was a snake but not what kind of snake, so I wouldn't have known what to search anyway. It was also faster for me to click than to type."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"If I knew what it was then I clicked the right one, if not then I hovered over top reccomendation and compared the image to the reference image."
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I would look at the top result and see if it looked like that. If not, I would type in the search what I thought it would be"
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I usually used the AIs first prediction unless I knew for sure it wasn't that, in that case I looked at the other predictions or I typed something in and searched and looked through the images"
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,"I first checked the image and then checked the top 3 predictions. If I felt those were not accurate, I then checked the rest of the suggestions. If none matched, I would type in a keyword."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I studied the image as closely as possible and concluded what I thought was in the image. Then, I referenced the AI classifier prediction, and for most of the images, the AI's prediction matched what I thought was in the image."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"In some cases, I relied on my own knowledge of birds and dog breeds, as I consider myself fairly knowledgeable in those areas.  With reptiles and crabs, I am less knowledgeable.  For some very abstract images, I assumed the AI had at least as good a guess as I could come up with."
UNINFORMATIVE,,,Just did the best I could
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,,The AI classifier gave some good and often correct suggestions however it wasn't accurate enough for me to consider paying too much to use it at this time.  It helped narrow down the dog breed for example however the top prediction was incorrect.  It was sometimes useful to see the image of the suggestion however not much more than doing a browser search.  We're getting close which is why I enjoy any studies related to AI.
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,,"I first used the AI top choice, or the second or third, in determining how much the features looked alike.  If none looked anything like it, then I took a best guess at the category (bird, cat, snake, etc.).  From there I narrowed it down based on the images provided in the tree view.  The difficulty was the different positions or angles of the photos compared to the other choices.  I'd have to do things such as count legs, recognized shapes, count the segments of the insects body parts, etc.  Overall the AI was the most useful tool, as the best starting point, in about 70-80% of the images.

Good study.  Thank you."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,I first looked at the labels that the AI gave. If I disagreed with what it gave I clicked and looked through the more specific categories
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"Typically, I tried to think of what it was myself and then view the AI's predictors to see if they aligned at all. For example, I don't know dog breeds at all so I relied heavily on the AI's predictors and searched through their pictures/related animals. If they were all related (Sennenhunds), then I assumed that it reliably would have been one of those if the pictures all matched up (which they did). For ones I did not know whatsoever, I looked at the predictor's top images and picked it if it matched (which I did for Sea Cucumber). For the Coral Reef photo, I knew it was on the sea floor and none of the AI predictor's matches seemed to make sense so I looked in depth in the trees for ""sea"" and found ""coral reef"", compared the picture, and chose that one."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"If I had doubts about the AI prediction, I would look for other things related to that to see if it matched any of those options"
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"the AI was correct most of the time, but other times there was no option but to guess on my own."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TOP PREDICTION FALLACY,,Most of the time if there was a specific item and the image was clear then I used the AI top hits but otherwise I would just try to guess
UNINFORMATIVE,,,he images were so fuzzy it was hard to identify them.  The IA's predictions did not always make sense.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,compared my thoughts to AI prediction.
REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,,By clicking the picture after searching for things that looked similar to the original pic.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"I was able to tell what most of them were without the AI, but the pictures of the keywords were helpful in determining the few that I couldn't get on my own, like the coral reef and the grouse."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"i would look at the AI's suggestions first then go diggin on my own if i didnt see one that fit
"
UNINFORMATIVE,,,similarities
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),"I originally started with what i thought the picture was. If i knew, i would check if it was on the AI list, and then start searching from there. If i had no clue what the image specifically was, i would start with the AI list for clues. Looking at the higher percentage one, and seeing what made sense. Then trying to hone in on the most accurate choice."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I looked at the image and came to my own conclusions first, before checking with the AI. I mostly used the AI to see the example pictures and access the label trees, basically a shortcut to see the limits of my answers instead of just trying keywords. It was a more fun than just trying keywords, but I would have been fine without it. Maybe even better off, in some circumstances."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,I didn't really need the help of the A.l except for 1 or 2 times. I was able to distinguish what most of them were.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,SEARCH,,"I looked at the image, if the AI had an option that seemed possible I checked the image, if I disagreed with all of the AI's predictions I simply used the database to search up what I thought it was."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,"I tried to match the picture with the pictures provided by the AI. Some were very clearly identified by the AI but some I guessed on my own.  I think the AI did a very good though, it seems to be right quite a bit."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,I looked at the shape of the object as well as the surrounding area if I could. I also looked at the different categories in response to what I was looking for
UNINFORMATIVE,,,following directions of course
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,I chose the AI prediction if I agreed with it or if I didnt know the image
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"When I could tell what it was, I used my own judgement. When I didn't know, I used the AI's label that had the highest probability."
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,,I looked at the percentages on the pictures where i couldnt tell and went what looked the closest to them
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,I compared AI's percentage of confidence with my own basic knowledge and level of image recognition to label the image.
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,,I checked the AI recommendation with highest accuracy.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,ELIMINATION,,"If I could identify it myself, I more or less ignored what the AI said. If I had no idea, I picked the AI's top choice after filtering out the ones that don't make sense"
COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,I tried to look at the images and the surrounding areas to the main object. Looked at the suggestions to some AI and a lot of the times it was accurate.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"i knew what most of the things were. but for the ones i didnt, i looked at the suggested searches to see if there was anything similar to what i was looking for. then from there it was pretty easy to see what it was, and what it wasnt, to help narrow it down"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,I used deductive reasoning to analyze the image. I then looked at the AI-provided potential answers to see if any matched with my suspected answer.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,The AI helped me to make more right decisions.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I tried to see what the AI predicted first and if I wasn't sure what the image was I would try to put together the AI prediction with my own thoughts and try to figure out what it was that I was looking at as many times the AI prediction was not correct but it was a great help at giving me ideas to what I was even looking at. It also helped me find names for things whose names I didn't know or was unsure about.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"Well, I knew many of the images, so I didn't need help with a lot of them. But the AI was very often helpful. The ones I didn't know, the AI definitely provided a lot of help, often leading me to the correct labeling with ease. It wasn't always the highest ranking choice on the list, but the correct label was often within that list."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,DISAPPOINTED AT AI,I found I did not agree with the AI prediction most of the time. I just tried to identify the object based on what I knew more.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH,,It was difficult to see what the subject was in most images. The AI classifier helped me gain understanding of what I was looking at. If I wasn't completely sure I could click to view similar things and find what I was looking for.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),,"I first looked and saw if I had an idea what it would be. If so, I looked to see if it was on the list. If it was, I went with that. If not, I looked at some of the top choices from the AI and see if any of them made more sense. Then I just went with what seemed the most likely to me."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),"If I recognized the image and it matched one of the top two predictions, I went with my gut. Otherwise, I analyzed each potential match for the one that looked the most similar to me. If none were similar, I took a guess and searched that keyword for a match."
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),"When I could not identify the item, I used the AI recommendations and the photos showed when hovering over each recommendation. By comparing the picture to identify with the provided photo, I was able to compare them and determine how similar or different they were. I used the AI classifier predictions about 25% of the time."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,Sometimes the AIs patch to finding the prediction was very unique and not a path I would follow.  With the categories it went through it was simple to narrow down if I felt it incorrect.  It seemed as though if the image had a blur effect that it was more difficult for the AI to narrow down
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,ELIMINATION,,"I just looked at the pictures. Some were really hard to discern. Obviously I eliminated the ones that were obviously not the image. Like if it said computer and it was an image of a dog, then I didn't need to look at the image of a computer."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,I would look at the image and see if there was anything I could identify. If the picture was too vague then I would refer to the AI. I would browse through all the AI suggestions and look for a similarity.
COLOR & SURROUNDINGS,,,By looking at the overall composition of the image and identifying the objects that are taking up the most space or are the most visually prominent.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,Taking a look at the pics from the AI's predictions and looking at the image to see how they matched.
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,,"For images that were very hard to make out I went with what the AI chose more often, for others I would click on an image that was closest to the correct choice than look through what comes up and see if there was a better selection."
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,I went by the prediction and by the things I thought I saw in the picture that best I could.
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"For the most part the AI was pretty accurate, the accuracy fell a lot when the images were blurry though.  I used the AI's top 3 suggestions to compare images with the original."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,,,"When the images were obvious, there was not difficulty identifying them, but the ones that were distorted in some way required some pretty out-of-the-box thinking to determine what they were. I was not successful every time, but I did manage to nail a few."
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,I used the top AI classifier and used that to compare with the image. Sometimes I used the keywords to search depending if the AI did not match the keywords.
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,SEARCH,,"If I knew the image and it wasn't among the results I would search for it. If I had no idea what it was I used the AI to help me, often looking through the different possibilities the AI offered to determine the best guess"
UNINFORMATIVE,,,I just followed the instructions
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,"The AI in this study was surprisingly accurate. Most of the rounds, the AI had the answer correctly. I would look at the image and then look at the AI's choices and would make a decision that closely matched the picture."
SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,I looked for labels I thought was appropriate via the search then looked at the ai generated list and compared the answers.
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,"I used AI about half the time, usually when trying to figure out types of animals.  A few times I thought AI was wrong but I was wrong as well."
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,"If I didn't know what it was I took the highest recommendation from the ai, if I did know what it was I would override the ai"
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"I first started with how clear or blurry the image was. If it was a clear image, I would then scan the AI suggestions if I didn't know what the animal was. I would compare each animal with the photos that AI had provided in the categories, and carefully compare to the clear image to see what is the closest match. Once I found the photo to me that I think matches the closest, I would then choose that particular animal.

If it was a blurry image, I used a dependence strategy where I would depend on the AI suggestions to help make out what could possibly be in the photo. I would look for patterns of similar shapes or figures that are seen in the AI image suggestions connect to the hierarchy. I would trust the AI, and then choose the animal that I thought matched with the most features or characteristics in the image itself. In this case, I heavily relied on scanning and analyzing the images and animals that the AI suggested, and carefully went through to look at the images, reconstructing what I think the animal is based on the the clear images that AI has it's its hierarchy database. "
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,"I checked the AI prediction first, and if it seemed correct, I checked a few of the others listed. If the top AI prediction was the best, I went with that. If I knew for sure that the top AI prediction wasn't the right one, I looked down the list to find the next one it would match, and chose that one."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,,,I mostly just relied on the AI except for a few where I was positive it was wrong. Those I just guessed at  after looking at all the suggestions from the AI and seeing what it might be seeing.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,I know a lot of the items I was asked to identify. I used my best judgement and when I had not idea I went with the suggestion.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,"I tried to first find the best subsection that fit, then looked for image that most closely matched the one given."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I just tried to identify what it was and then I went over thee AI's options and if something matched, I picked what it was and if it didn't, I tried to figure it out on my own."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I looked at the image and guessed what it was, without looking at the AI classifier.  Then I checked the AI classifier to see if any of the choices confirmed my guess.  If one did, then I picked that one.  If none did, then I studied all the AI predictions and decided which one was the most accurate.   If I had no idea what the image was (half the time), then I relied heavily on the AI classifier, looking at the sample photos to see which ones matched the image best.   I looked at as many photos as necessary until I found a decent match."
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"I thought about what the image looked like to me with my knowledge, and then compared that thought to the suggested predictions."
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),,"The AI was useful in assisting me to make the correct choice in several instances. Other times, I had to use the chart and hover over different words to try to make a guess. Some pictures were very blurry and hard to even make a guess what I was looking at, and the AI's guesses weren't helpful with those. There was one picture of what the AI guessed to be a black bear, and I chose something else and didn't get the correct answer. It seemed like sometimes the AI made better guesses than I did apparently."
AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,TOP PREDICTION FALLACY,,"I took the AI's classifications into consideration when trying to understand the image if I was unsure what I was looking at. While I did consider the weighted percentages shown, I felt it was too confident with the blurry images or the images with high exposure or noise. Sadly, there were a large amount of constraints in place in terms of available classifications, particularly when it came to specific subsets of animals and bridges."
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),SEARCH (BY AI LABEL),I first looked at the Al predictions and hovered over the labels to see a picture of the label. I than highlighted and selected the label I thought was correct. Lastly I hovered over the images within the overlay and selected the image I thought was appropriate. I heavily relied on the Al predictions.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,I would look through the AI's pictures to see if they looked like a match and searched by keyword if they did not.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE & SEARCH,,,"Not sure if I really had a strategy. If I thought it was right, I went with it. If I did not, I just went down the list to see what it looked like and narrowed it down from there."
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,AI was mostly helpful because I was very dependent on it.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,The AI helped me in identifying names for the various images. The classifications helped in making a choice.
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,"After the first couple, I identified a strategy of just kind of leaning towards believing the AI classifier unless I thought it was unlikely.  I'd explore any other hunches I had, or look for closely-related images that might be a better choice, but generally just stuck with the AI suggestion."
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,I went with the help of my AI
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,"I used the AI classifier's prediction to identify most of the images, it was very helpful"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,SEARCH,,I literally looked up the images. There were some that i knew what it was but had to complromise with the AI classifier to come up with the closest thing. I searched in categories that did not apply even to see if there was a hiding spot for the correct response.
AI ADVICE 1ST & HUMAN CONFIRM 2ND,REPRESENTATIVE IMAGES,,I looked through each photo of the top 10 to see which looked like the photo.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,I tried to see if I could tell what the image was prior to looking at AI predictions. If I could not or needed to double check I made sure it was on the list if I could not figure out I would look at AI predictions images.
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,AI ADVICE WHEN HARD,,"I would use my own judgement first in order to try and figure out what the image depicted. If I ran out of ideas, or if I needed to know specifics, then I used the AI prediction to help narrow it down."
TRUST AI PREDICTION(S),,,AI was reasonably accurate and helpful. I would love to see what the correct answers were for the ones I missed. Maybe I should have taken the AI advice more?? If I could not identify the picture I used the top suggestion.
SEARCH,,,"using search, going through pictures...some were blurry"
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 1ST & AI ADVICE 2ND,,,"If I was certain in my identification, I did not worry about the AI. If there was some uncertainty, I would examine the AI's identifications and make a choice. Sometimes I just guessed because I did not think any of the 10 AI identifications were correct."
HUMAN-AI COMPARISON,,,I tried to use my knowledge along with the AI clues.
UNINFORMATIVE,,,
UNINFORMATIVE,,,
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),SEARCH (HIERARCHY NETWORK),,I used the AI's predictions (when the answer wasn't obvious) as a basis for where to start in the tree and explored the tree from there.
TRUST AI (RANKING OR CONFIDENCE),SEARCH (BY KEYWORD),,I tried to look at the one that had the highest percentage of people that thought it was that image and then I compared within the search. There were a few where I just could not think of the word to search.
